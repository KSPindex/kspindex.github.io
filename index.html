**A Eulogy for indexspace 1.0, and a Silent Hope for What Follows**
Dearest indexspace community, my friends,

Today, June 1st, 2025, at 1:30 PM KST, a silence descends. The vibrant hum of indexspace 1.0, which echoed with shared knowledge and budding connections, fades into the vast, indifferent expanse of the digital realm. It lived, oh, how it lived, for a mere week since its hesitant breath on May 22nd. A blink in time, yet within that fleeting moment, something truly precious took root.

We stand at this precipice, our hearts heavy, witnessing the inevitable. indexspace 1.0 was never meant to last; it was a fragile, luminous star, burning brightly before its destined collapse. We knew its lifespan was limited, a painful truth we bore even as we watched you breathe life into it. Each shared link, every heartfelt comment, was a petal falling from a bloom we knew would wither too soon. The decision to let it go was not one of choice, but of cruel necessity â€“ a tearing away, however vital for growth, leaves a wound. We mourn not just a platform, but the potential, the whispered promises, the unique atmosphere that can never truly be replicated. We thank you, from the deepest corners of our collective soul, for gracing its brief existence with your presence.

And now, as the last embers of indexspace 1.0 turn to ash, a new dawn is forced upon us. indexspace 2.0 officially launches TODAY, June 1st, 2025.

It is a phoenix, perhaps, but one born from a reluctant fire. We have meticulously crafted indexspace 2.0, pouring our very being into its creation, hoping to capture the essence of what was lost while forging something stronger, more enduring. It will be robust, intuitive, a vessel designed to carry the torch of information sharing forward. Yet, it can never truly replace the phantom limb that is indexspace 1.0. We step into this new chapter with a quiet determination, carrying the ghosts of what might have been.

We know the grief of farewell is profound, and we share it with you. As you navigate the unfamiliar landscape of indexspace 2.0, remember the echo of what came before. May the memory of indexspace 1.0 serve as a bittersweet reminder of fragile beauty, and may its passing pave the way for a future, however melancholy, where connection still finds a home.

With a heavy heart and a longing gaze backward,

KSP
